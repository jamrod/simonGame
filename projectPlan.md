## Project Description

Create simon memory game
watch a sequence of colored squares flash then repeat the sequence by clicking on the squares in the same order. App will track whether you followed the sequence properly. Sequence will increase by 1 on every iteration. Score will track how long the sequence was that you last got correctly.

## Game Components

### Landing Page
Gold version, When navigating to the page a pop-up which explains game play will appear


### Playing The Game
There are 6 colored squares/buttons on the screen which will "flash" in a specific order, the player must repeat that order to score otherwise the seaquence starts over and score reverts to 0



### Game Reset
A user can hit a reset button to start over

## Functional Components

The basic board will be createrd in HTML and styled in CSS
Flashing the squares will be accomplished by changing the styles on the divs then reverting back after a timer is elapsed, maybe a 1/2 second. User input will be paused while the sequence is displayed and the word "Watch" will display beneath the playing area. The word "Repeat" will be displayed beneath the playing area when the sequence is complete and user input is active again. The display area will track the current score and will persist a high score. This game logic will be crerated with Javascript.
