Create simon memory game.

watch a sequence of colored squares flash then repeat the sequence by clicking on the squares in the same order. App will track whether you followed the sequence properly. Sequence will increase by 1 on every iteration. Score will track how long the sequence was that you last got correctly.

There are 6 colored squares/buttons on the screen which will "flash" in a specific order, the player must repeat that order to score otherwise the seaquence starts over and score reverts to 0. User input will be paused while the sequence is displayed and the word "Watch" will display beneath the playing area. The word "Repeat" will be displayed beneath the playing area when the sequence is complete and user input is active again. The display area will track the current score and will persist a high score.
