Memory game

Test your short-term memory!
There are six colored buttons on the screen which will "flash" in a specific order, the player must repeat that order to score otherwise the sequence starts over and score reverts to 0. User input will be paused while the sequence is displayed and the word "Watch" will display beneath the playing area. The word "Repeat" will be displayed beneath the playing area when the sequence is complete and user input is active again. The sequence starts with one button and increases by one each time the player repeats it correctly. The display area will track the current score and will persist a "Highscore" for the browser session and an "All Time Highscore" per browser.
