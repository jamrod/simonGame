Create simon memory game.

There are 6 colored squares/buttons on the screen which will "flash" in a specific order, the player must repeat that order to score otherwise the sequence starts over and score reverts to 0. User input will be paused while the sequence is displayed and the word "Watch" will display beneath the playing area. The word "Repeat" will be displayed beneath the playing area when the sequence is complete and user input is active again. The display area will track the current score and will persist a high score.
